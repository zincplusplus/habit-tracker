## Now
- refactor the code so we can debug issues especially around dates
- give a UI version to configure this
- show streak even if it's starting from before the 21(displayed days)

## Next

- pass Today as a variable
- link to pages
- listen for changes and auto update
- auto switch to new day at midnight
- allow user to create a habit from the tracker
- show only habits that have activity in the past 21 days
- settings page
- add dashboard for each habit with stats (current streak, avg streak, best streak, avg completion rate etc)

## Done

- make it work in reading mode
- publish it
- readme/tutorial
- allow user to specify the path
- make it work in portrait mode
- error handling

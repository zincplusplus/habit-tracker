# Changelog

## 1.4.0
feat: track how many times the plugin is loaded at every version; it's important to see that people actually stick with using it, and that they adopt new versions, so I can decide how much time to invest in this project. I'm using bit.ly for this and all I care about is page views

fix: daysToShow is converted to a number if the user passes it as a string
